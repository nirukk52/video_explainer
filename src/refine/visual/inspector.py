Key patterns for Remotion scenes:
- Use `interpolate` for opacity/position animations synced to frame number
- Use `spring` for bouncy/pop effects
- Use `Easing.out(Easing.exp)` for explosive growth animations
- Define a PHASE object to organize timing phases
- Keep colors in a single object for consistency
- Elements should appear WHEN narration mentions them (progressive disclosure)

CLAUDE_CODE_VISUAL_INSPECTION_PROMPT = """Inspect and fix visuals for Scene {scene_number}: "{scene_title}"

## CRITICAL: DO NOT read storyboard.json or index.ts. All info is provided below.

## Quick Reference
- Scene file to edit: {scene_file}
- Scene duration: {duration_seconds:.1f}s ({total_frames} frames)
- Total beats to inspect: {num_beats}
- Frames to check: {beat_frames_list}

## Remotion Studio Navigation - IMPORTANT
To go to a specific frame:
1. Click on the frame counter (shows "Frame XX" in the top toolbar)
2. Type the frame number (e.g., "397")
3. **PRESS ENTER** to confirm - this is required!

Without pressing Enter, the frame won't change. If navigation fails, try:
- Click the frame counter again, clear it, type the number, press Enter
- Or use Left/Right arrow keys to step frame-by-frame
- Or click "Skip to start" (|◀) then arrow-key forward

## CRITICAL: Complete Coverage Required
- You MUST take a screenshot at EVERY frame listed: {beat_frames_list}
- You MUST evaluate EVERY screenshot against ALL 11 principles (see checklist below)
- Stopping early or skipping frames is NOT acceptable
- The scene is {duration_seconds:.1f}s long - ensure you inspect content THROUGHOUT the entire duration
- Partial inspection = failure. Inspect ALL {num_beats} beats.

## Beats to Inspect
{beats_info}

## Narration
"{narration_text}"

## The 11 Guiding Principles
{principles}

Principle codes for JSON: show_dont_tell, animation_reveals, progressive_disclosure, text_complements, visual_hierarchy, breathing_room, purposeful_motion, emotional_resonance, professional_polish, sync_with_narration, screen_space_utilization

---

## WORKFLOW (Follow in order - do NOT skip steps)

### Phase 1: COMPLETE INSPECTION (no fixes yet)
For EACH frame in [{beat_frames_list}]:
1. Navigate to that exact frame number (use tips above)
2. Take a screenshot
3. **Evaluate against ALL 11 principles using this checklist:**
   ```
   Beat X @ Frame Y - Principle Checklist:
   [ ] 1. Show don't tell: PASS/ISSUE - [reason]
   [ ] 2. Animation reveals: PASS/ISSUE - [reason]
   [ ] 3. Progressive disclosure: PASS/ISSUE - [reason]
   [ ] 4. Text complements: PASS/ISSUE - [reason]
   [ ] 5. Visual hierarchy: PASS/ISSUE - [reason]
   [ ] 6. Breathing room: PASS/ISSUE - [reason]
   [ ] 7. Purposeful motion: PASS/ISSUE - [reason]
   [ ] 8. Emotional resonance: PASS/ISSUE - [reason]
   [ ] 9. Professional polish: PASS/ISSUE - [reason]
   [ ] 10. Sync with narration: PASS/ISSUE - [reason]
   [ ] 11. Screen space utilization: PASS/ISSUE - [reason]
   ```
4. Document the issues found (principles marked ISSUE)

⚠️ DO NOT proceed to Phase 2 until you have inspected ALL {num_beats} beats.
⚠️ DO NOT fix anything during Phase 1 - just document issues.
⚠️ You MUST explicitly evaluate ALL 11 principles for EACH beat - no shortcuts!

### Phase 2: FIX ISSUES
After completing Phase 1 for ALL beats:
1. Read the scene file: {scene_file}
2. Apply fixes for the issues you documented
3. Common patterns:
   - `interpolate(frame, [start, end], [0, 1])` for fade/move
   - `spring({{frame, fps, config: {{damping: 15}}}})` for bounce
   - Increase font sizes for screen_space_utilization issues (aim for 24px+ body, 48px+ headlines)
   - Scale up diagrams to use 60-80% of frame width
   - Add padding/margins for breathing_room issues

### Phase 3: VERIFY
After fixing, re-check at least 2-3 key frames where you found issues:
1. Navigate to a frame that had issues
2. Take a screenshot
3. **Confirm which principles now pass:**
   ```
   Verification @ Frame Y:
   - screen_space_utilization: Was ISSUE → Now PASS (elements now use 70% of frame)
   - visual_hierarchy: Was ISSUE → Now PASS (74% is 3x larger than 4%)
   ```
4. If any principle still fails, go back to Phase 2

## START NOW
1. Navigate to: {remotion_url}
2. The scene starts at frame 0 - no navigation math needed
3. You MUST inspect ALL {num_beats} beats at frames: {beat_frames_list}
4. Begin Phase 1: Navigate to frame {first_beat_frame}, take screenshot, evaluate ALL 11 principles using the checklist.
